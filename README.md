# Movie Recommendation engine
This project is divided into two parts:
1. The​ ​Story​ ​of​ ​Film:​ ​This section aims at narrating the history, trivia and facts behind the
world of cinema through the lens of data. Extensive Exploratory Data Analysis is
performed on Movie Metadata about Movie Revenues, Casts, Crews, Budgets, etc.
through the years. Two predictive models are built to predict movie revenues and movie
success. Through these models, we also aim at discovering what features have the most
significant impact in determining revenue and success.
2. Movie​ ​Recommender​ ​Systems:​ ​This part is focused around building various kinds of
recommendation engines; namely the Simple Generic Recommender, the Content Based
Filter and the User Based Collaborative Filter. The performance of the systems are
evaluated in both a qualitative and quantitative manner.
